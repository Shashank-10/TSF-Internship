# The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program). As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the March 2021 batch.

Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

### Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

### Technical : Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.

I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.

### Technical : Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

I will be doing this with the help of python libraries i.e. matplotlib and seaborn. Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

As a business manager, we will try to find out the weak areas where we can work tomake more profit. Also, what all business problems can be derived by exploring the data.

### Technical : Task 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

I will be doing this with the help of seaborn, plotly and folium libraries in python. Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

As a security/defense analyst, we will try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. Also, what all security issues and insights can be derived by EDA.
